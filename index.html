                     Welcome to the NeuroLang Lab (NLL) @ The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)! ​Our lab focus on a range of contemporary cognitive neuroscience research approaches, including event-related potentials (ERP), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), as well as systems neuroscience techniques such as multivariate neural decoding and connectivity pattern analyses, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying language learning, speech, and lexical-semantic processing in both adults and clinical populations. Lab’s research has been published in a number of high-profile international journals, including the PNAS, the Journal of Neuroscience, Cerebral Cortex, Neuroimage, Human Brain Mapping, and Neurobiology of Language. Prof.Gangyi Feng, who is the principal investigator of our lab, has received funding for his research from various external and university sources, including the General Research Fund, Collaborative Research Fund, Innovation and Technology Fund, National Science Foundation of China, and National Institutes of Health. Students in Linguistics, Psychology, Education, Computer Science, Statistics, Engineering, or a related major are welcome to contact Prof. Feng for Ph.D. program application.
